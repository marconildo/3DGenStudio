; Custom NSIS logic for the 3D Gen Studio Windows installer/uninstaller.
;
; Three independent overrides live here:
;   1. customRemoveFiles / customInit - directory-link (junction) safety.
;   2. customCheckAppRunning          - the "app is still running" check.
;   3. customRemoveFiles / customUnInstall - "delete your data too?" on uninstall
;      (both drive the same un.MaybeRemoveAppData; see it for why).
;
; WHY THE LINK PURGE EXISTS
; -------------------------
; electron-builder's stock uninstaller removes the app with a single
;   RMDir /r $INSTDIR
; (see node_modules/app-builder-lib/templates/nsis/uninstaller.nsh). NSIS's
; recursive delete does NOT check for reparse points: it walks straight THROUGH
; directory junctions and symlinks and deletes the contents of whatever they
; point at — on any drive. Anyone who relocates big folders with `mklink /J`
; (very common for ComfyUI models) and has such a link anywhere inside the
; install tree loses the link TARGET, not just the app.
;
; Reproduced against the exact toolchain we ship with (NSIS 3.0.4.1, the version
; electron-builder 25.x pins): a junction inside $INSTDIR pointing at a folder on
; another drive had its entire contents destroyed by `RMDir /r $INSTDIR`.
; Re-confirmed for a directory SYMLINK (mklink /D, the other thing people use to
; move model folders off the system drive): models\checkpoints -> elsewhere, and
; a stock `RMDir /r` on the parent emptied the target folder as well. Both link
; kinds carry FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT, so the purge below covers both, plus
; volume mount points.
;
; The update path is affected too, and worse: un.atomicRMDir `Rename`s each entry
; into $PLUGINSDIR\old-install for rollback, and NSIS wipes $PLUGINSDIR
; recursively when it exits — which removed the link target directory outright.
;
; THE FIX
; -------
; Before anything recursive happens, walk the tree and remove any directory
; reparse point with a plain `RMDir` (no /r). That deletes the LINK and leaves
; the target untouched — verified. Once the tree contains no links, the stock
; recursive delete can only reach real app files.
;
; Defining `customRemoveFiles` replaces the vendor's whole delete block, so the
; atomic-rename rollback for updates is reproduced here rather than lost.
;
; `customInit` applies the same purge on the installer side. That is the only
; thing that can protect someone upgrading FROM a version whose uninstaller
; predates this fix, because the installer hands the old (unsafe) uninstaller the
; job of clearing the previous install.

!include LogicLib.nsh

; Number of links neutralized in this run, used to decide whether to tell the user.
Var /GLOBAL purgedLinkCount

; electron-builder 26.x added a PowerShell fast path to the vendor FIND_PROCESS /
; KILL_PROCESS macros, gated on $IsPowerShellAvailable. That variable is declared by
; IS_POWERSHELL_AVAILABLE, which CHECK_APP_RUNNING only inserts when NO
; customCheckAppRunning is defined - i.e. never for us (see below). Inserting
; FIND_PROCESS therefore compiles a reference to a variable that does not exist:
;   warning 6000: unknown variable/constant "IsPowerShellAvailable" detected
; and since electron-builder runs makensis with warnings-as-errors, that aborts
; `electron-builder --win` at the uninstaller step. It surfaced when the electron /
; electron-builder dependencies were updated.
;
; We declare it here and pin it to 1 ("PowerShell not available") in
; customCheckAppRunning, so FIND_PROCESS keeps taking its tasklist branch. That is
; not a fallback, it is required for correctness: the PowerShell branch matches ANY
; process whose image path lies under $INSTDIR - python.exe from the Mesh Tools /
; rigging / motion services included - while the kill below is APP_TASKKILL, which
; only ever targets ${APP_EXECUTABLE_FILENAME}. Mixing the two would give a check
; that keeps reporting "still running" for a process the kill can never touch: an
; endless prompt loop instead of an install.
Var /GLOBAL IsPowerShellAvailable

; Generates PurgeLinks (installer) / un.PurgeLinks (uninstaller) from one body.
; Usage: Push "<absolute directory>" then Call ${UN}PurgeLinks
;
; Depth-first. For every child directory we ask the filesystem for its attributes
; and branch:
;   FILE_ATTRIBUTE_REPARSE_POINT (0x400) -> RMDir, i.e. unlink, never recurse
;   FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY     (0x010) -> recurse
; Attributes are read with GetFileAttributesW, which reports the link's own
; attributes and does not follow it. Broken links are still caught, because we
; test the attribute bits rather than asking whether the path is a directory.
;
; Files are deliberately left alone: DeleteFile on a file symlink removes the
; link and not its target, so the stock recursive delete is already safe there.

; "IS THE APP STILL RUNNING?" CHECK
; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Defining customCheckAppRunning replaces the vendor macro _CHECK_APP_RUNNING
; (node_modules/app-builder-lib/templates/nsis/include/allowOnlyOneInstallerInstance.nsh),
; which both the installer (installSection.nsh) and the old version's
; uninstaller (un.onInit) call before touching any file.
;
; THE PROBLEM
; -----------
; Detection is by image name only:
;   tasklist /FI "USERNAME eq %USERNAME%" /FI "IMAGENAME eq <app>.exe"
; and EVERY process the app creates carries that name: the Electron helpers
; (GPU, renderer, utility) and - the one that actually bites - the backend,
; which electron/main.cjs spawns as the app executable itself with
; ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE. The backend has no window, so it sits under "Background
; processes" where nobody looks.
;
; So users saw "3D Gen Studio is running" for an app they had closed, and the
; vendor loop then failed them twice over:
;   - its first kill attempt is a plain `taskkill` (no /f), which only posts
;     WM_CLOSE to top-level windows - a no-op against exactly the window-less
;     process that is blocking the install;
;   - when the single force attempt does not work either, it dead-ends on
;     "please close it manually", advice that cannot be followed for a process
;     with no window. Restarting Windows was the only way out.
;
; WHY ONLY "INSTALL FOR ME" HITS THIS
; -----------------------------------
; Reported from the field: the dialog appears for a per-user install but never
; for an all-users one. That is not a difference in detection - the all-users
; path never checks at all. With perMachine: false, picking "anyone who uses
; this computer" makes the installer relaunch itself elevated, and the install
; section then runs in that inner instance, where the vendor guards the call:
;
;   ${ifNot} ${UAC_IsInnerInstance}     ; installSection.nsh
;     !insertmacro CHECK_APP_RUNNING
;   ${endif}
;
; A per-user install needs no elevation, so it IS the outer instance and the
; check runs. Worth knowing before chasing a per-user-only detection bug that
; does not exist - and worth remembering that an all-users install therefore
; happily writes over a running app.
;
; WHAT CHANGES
; ------------
;   - the graceful pass gets a real window to finish in (~3 s of polling)
;     instead of the vendor's 300 ms, so a visible app can shut its own children
;     down cleanly;
;   - the force pass then actually runs, repeatedly, instead of once;
;   - if force-killing still fails, Setup offers to retry with administrator
;     rights. A per-user install runs unelevated, so `taskkill /f` against an app
;     that was started as administrator returns "Access is denied" forever - the
;     elevated retry is the only thing short of a reboot that clears that;
;   - the last-resort dialog names the background process and the exact taskkill
;     command instead of "close it manually". English only: LangStrings are not
;     available this early in the script, so the localized $(appRunning) is still
;     used for the first prompt.

; taskkill against every process with the app's image name except this one.
; The per-user branch mirrors the vendor's: a per-user install must not (and
; cannot) touch another account's processes.
; _FLAGS is "" for the graceful pass (WM_CLOSE) or "/f" to terminate.

  ; "DO YOU WANT YOUR DATA DELETED TOO?"
  ; -------------------------------------------------------------------------
  ; The app keeps everything it writes in one per-user folder:
  ;   %APPDATA%\3DGenStudio          (electron/main.cjs: app.setName + userData)
  ; and the stock uninstaller leaves it behind. That is the safe default, but it
  ; also means a "clean" reinstall is never clean, and a user who does want their
  ; data gone has to know the path.
  ;
  ; WHY NOT deleteAppDataOnUninstall
  ; -------------------------------
  ; electron-builder has that option, but it (a) never asks and (b) deletes the
  ; WRONG folders: its block removes $APPDATA\${APP_FILENAME} ("3D Gen Studio",
  ; the installation directory name), $APPDATA\${APP_PRODUCT_FILENAME} and
  ; $APPDATA\${APP_PACKAGE_NAME} ("app", from package.json name). None of those
  ; is where the data lives, because main.cjs calls app.setName('3DGenStudio')
  ; before the first getPath('userData') - so the option would delete nothing of
  ; ours and possibly something of somebody else's.
  ;
  ; WHY TWO QUESTIONS
  ; -----------------
  ; The folder mixes two very different things:
  ;   small and irreplaceable - data\app.db, data\assets, wiki, settings, logs
  ;   huge and re-downloadable - comfyui, comfy-venv, comfy-data (models),
  ;                              rig-venv, rig-data (model weights), motion-venv,
  ;                              motion-data (Kimodo + text encoder), python-venv
  ; Wiping the second group can mean re-downloading tens of gigabytes and
  ; rebuilding three Python environments, so someone who only wants a clean slate
  ; for their projects gets the middle option. What is kept is enough for the
  ; managed installs to be recognized again: comfysetup.cjs reads its receipt
  ; from the venv dir, not from the database. The ComfyUI port and the "use the
  ; managed install" toggle do live in settings, so those return to their
  ; defaults and are re-applied on the next start.
  ;
  ; WHEN NOTHING IS ASKED AND NOTHING IS DELETED
  ; --------------------------------------------
  ;   - updates: installUtil.nsh runs the OLD uninstaller as
  ;     `/S /KEEP_APP_DATA --updated`, and an update must never touch data;
  ;   - silent uninstalls, unless --delete-app-data is passed - the same flag
  ;     electron-builder's own uninstaller accepts, rather than a second
  ;     spelling of it. It means "delete everything".
  ;
  ; Junctions are as dangerous here as they are in the install dir - relocating
  ; comfy-data\models to another drive with `mklink /J` is common practice - so
  ; every recursive delete below is preceded by un.PurgeLinks.

  ;
  ; WHY NOT FROM customUnInstall ALONE
  ; ----------------------------------
  ; It used to be, and that silently stopped working. Up to electron-builder 25.x
  ; Section un.install inserted customRemoveFiles first and customUnInstall last,
  ; so "ask, then delete" fell out of the vendor order for free. 26.x reversed it
  ; (uninstaller.nsh now inserts customUnInstall BEFORE the delete block), which
  ; put the action ahead of the question: $appDataMode was still unset when
  ; customUnInstall ran, the ${If} below matched neither "1" nor "2", and the
  ; answer the user had just given was written to a variable nobody read again.
  ; The dialog appeared, "Yes" deleted nothing, and the data folder survived
  ; intact - which is exactly what was reported.
  ;
  ; Nothing warns about this: both macros are optional hooks, so a reordering is
  ; a silent behaviour change. Driving it from customRemoveFiles - the macro that
  ; asks - keeps question and answer in one place and in the right order whatever
  ; the vendor does with the insertion points. customUnInstall still calls it too,
  ; so an order that puts that hook after the delete block keeps working; the
  ; function is idempotent, so at most one of the two calls does anything.
