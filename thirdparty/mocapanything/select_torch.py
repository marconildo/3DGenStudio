"""Print the pip args for a CUDA-matched torch install, for run_server.

Mirrors python-server/detect_cuda.py: reads the CUDA version from nvidia-smi and
maps it to a PyTorch wheel index. Prints one line to stdout for the caller to
pass straight to `uv pip install`; diagnostics go to stderr. Prints nothing when
no NVIDIA GPU is present -- MoCapAnything needs one, so the caller should treat empty
output as "install CPU torch and warn".

Override with MOCAP_CUDA (e.g. `set MOCAP_CUDA=12.8`).
